# computerVisionFootball

Project uses object detection model & processes it's output to analyze the video of a football match & detect/calculate:
* player, referee and ball positions & track each object
* estimate camera movement
* estimate player speed

Model used to do initial object detection is a model trained in my other repo https://github.com/bcicvaric/computerVisionModelTuning
